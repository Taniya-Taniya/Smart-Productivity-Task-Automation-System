# Problem Statement

People often struggle to manage multiple tasks, keep track of deadlines, and plan their day efficiently. Manual scheduling is time-consuming and error-prone, which leads to poor productivity. There is a need for a simple and reliable system that can organise tasks, automate scheduling, and provide helpful insights to support better time management.

## Scope of the Project

The Smart Productivity and Task Automation System is a console-based Java application designed to streamline task planning. It focuses on:
- Creating, updating, viewing, and deleting tasks
- Automatically generating daily and weekly schedules
- Saving and loading tasks using local file storage
- Providing basic progress summaries
The scope is limited to command-line usage and text-file storage, without advanced UI or database integration.

## Target Users
This system is intended for:
- Students managing academic tasks and deadlines
- Working professionals organising daily workloads
- Anyone who wants a simple tool to plan tasks and improve time management
- Beginners learning Java who want to understand project structure and OOP concepts

## High-Level Features
- Task Management: Add, view, update, and delete tasks
- Automated Scheduling: Generate daily and weekly task schedules
- Progress Tracking: View summaries of completed and pending tasks
- File Storage: Persistent saving and loading of tasks using a text file
- Input Validation: Ensures safe and error-free user input
- Modular OOP Structure: Clean separation into models, services, and utilities
